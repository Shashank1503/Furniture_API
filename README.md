# Furniture Client API Repository

This is a simple express api for the Furniture Client.

## Installation

We will need node.js as we will use npm package manager for the installation of the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run start
```

## Note

We have to run this project first before running the client code.
